  The five coolest robots I think as following.
    1.DJI Spark(UAV.)
    2.Asimo(An excellent and beautiful humanoid)
    3.Atlas(Boston dynamics humanoid.)
    4.Valkyrie(NASA Robot.)
    5.Bigdog(A good carrier for army.)

  The reason why I think the UAV is a cool robot is that this robot can fly. Flying is always our
dream. And UAV is easy to mount a camera on it, then we can see many scenery through it. which
we cannot see. And I think Flapping-wing robot is amazing robot. It's an incredible idea brought
up ever.

  Challenges for humanoid household robot
    1.The greatest challenge is combining many abilities together. Although it's easy to do something simple
    , it's still difficult to put them on the same robot.
    2.And sensor fusion also can be a big challenge. That robot can do lots of different things means he need lots of sensor.
    3.Decision planner is challenge, too. If he has many things to do, which one do first and which one is next and what if unknown
    situation.
    4.Make it cheaper is the most important challenge for household robot.
